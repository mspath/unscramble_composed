# Unscramble Composed

Single player game app that displays scrambled words. To play the game, player has to make a
word using all the letters in the displayed scrambled word.

This code demonstrates the Android Architecture components ViewModel and StateFlow.

This app is developed as part of the [Android Basics with Compose] course from Google, see [Unit 4] [Pathway 1] and the [ViewModel and State in Compose] Codelab.

(it basically is the 'composed' cousin of the Unscramble app from Google's Android Basics with Kotlin Course)
